Welcome to FOR LEGAL PURPOSES, THIS DEFNITELY ISN'T CLUE MIXED WITH SLENDER MAN. 

I. How To Play
	Everything you need to play the game is in the folder you unzipped. 
	Navigate to said folder via your terminal or command window. 
	Enter the command "java GameRunner" to start the game. 
	Follow the instructions. 
	Enjoy!

II. Some Notes About This "Game"
	This was a school project.
	While it works, in that it does exactly what I inteded the program to do when I wrote it, it is not what I would call...fun. 
	There are multiple lose conditions. You WILL die. 
	There is no win condition. 
	So, all that said, just explore until you die or get bored.
